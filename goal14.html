				<h3>targets</h3>
				<h5>Target 14.1</h5>
				<p>by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution</p>
				<h5>Target 14.2</h5>
				<p>by 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, 
				and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans</p>
				<h5>Target 14.3</h5>
				<p>Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels</p>
				<h5>Target 14.4</h5>
				<p>by 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement 
				science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield 
				as determined by their biological characteristics</p>
				<h5>Target 14.5</h5>
				<p>by 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available 
				scientific information</p>
				<h5>Target 14.6</h5>
				<p>by 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, 
				unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment
				for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation</p>
				<h5>Target 14.7</h5>
				<p>by 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, 
				including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism</p>
				<h5>Target 14.a</h5>
				<p>Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
				Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the
				development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries</p>
				<h5>Target 14.b</h5>
				<p>Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</p>
				<h5>Target 14.c</h5>
				<p>Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in United Nations Convention 
				on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158
				of "The future we want"</p>

				<h3>national stock assessment program (nsap)</h3>
				<p>The Coastal and Marine Ecosystems Management Program aims to comprehensively manage, address and effectively reduce the drivers and threats of degradation
				of the coastal and marine ecosystems in order to achieve and promote sustainability of ecosystem services, food security, and climate change resiliency</p>
				<h5>Outcomes:</h5>
				<li>Establish a well-connected network of MPAs to ensure the effective and sustainable management of coastal resources</li>
				<li>Implement sustainable management of coastal and marine resources to contribute to food security and improve human well-being of the coastal communities</li>
				<li>Effectively reduce threats and factors of degradation on coastal and marine ecosystems</li>
				<li>Enhance the formation of positive values among all stakeholders including the youth through shared responsibilities in sustainable management of coastal
				and marine resources and habitats</li>
				<li>Develop and/or enhance the skills and expertise of DENR concerned staff as well as other stakeholders on coastal and marine management</li>
				</br>

			<div id="nsap" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>national stock assessment program (nsap)</h3>
				<p>The National Stock Assessment Program conducts assessment of major pelagic and demersal species in major fishing grounds of the county through establishment
				of standardized time series and biological data by fishing ground, which are fundamental to science-based fisheries management, formulation of policies, plans
				and strategies</p>
				<h5>Objectives:</h5>
				<li>To determine the catch per unit of effort, relative abundance, seasonality, and species composition of major species of gears</li>
				<li>To estimate the population parameters of selected major fish species</li>
				<li>To enhance and standardize the National Stock Assessment Program methodology and database</li>
				<li>To provide catch baselines that will be used to set reference points or harvest control rules which is a part of the Capture Fisheries strategy to implement
				science-based conservation and management measures as stated in the CNFIDP 2016-2020</li>
				<li>To provide limit reference points such as Exploitation values and Spawning Potential Ratio that will serve as guidelines in establishing harvest control rules
				for various commodity species</li>
